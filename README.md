Second project in Metis Data Science Bootcamp.



Has dengue affected the life expectancy of people in any country?

Do people in rich nations live longer?

What are the factors affecting life expectancy of a country?

In this project, I would like to predict the life expectancy of people in a country, and looked for data on the following aspects (features):
· Birth Rate
· Cancer Rate
· Dengue Cases
· Environmental Performance Index (EPI)
· Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
· Health Expenditure
· Heart Disease Rate
· Population
· Area
· Population Density
· Stroke Rate
I will use these data related to life expectancy to evaluate the following models: Linear, Ridge, LASSO, and Polynomial Regression. 

Here are some interesting insights:
1. Japan has the highest life expectancy (83.7 years). Central African Republic (49.5 years) and many countries in the African continent are at the bottom of scale. Singapore is ranked #5 (82.7 years).
2. Take good care of the environment. It has the largest coefficient (impact) on the country’s life expectancy.
